# Spotlight – AI Powered Webinar Streaming & Sales Platform 📈

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e8f027-9589-4d86-83d3-9bec21e60bd6)



Spotlight is an AI powered webinar streaming platform for marketers and business owners. Users can create webinars, show popup screens to attendees to book a call or buy a product during the livestream, track lead sales and sales progress and more.

The "book a call" CTA works best for high ticket services / or courses! The host can create breakout rooms for interested prospects and the AI sales agent can speak to leads and even close leads with the product link.

This AI sales agent can be trained and customized as per your liking.

Hosts can also track the progress of their leads in their sales cycle, and follow up with them to push a sale.
